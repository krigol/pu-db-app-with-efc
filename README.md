# Introduction 
This project is aimed at allowing sutdents to learn the basics of Azure DevOps, AppHarbor and Entity Framework
It will also teach students how to work in a team using SCRUM methodology
We will be building a space launch program. It would allow scientists to go through the full space launch process.

# Getting Started
To launch our app, just download the code and run it through your Visual Studio. Like all scientists!

# Release roadmap
1. (01.02)Have a registration and login panel. That way all the great scientists would need to give us their personal info! 
2. (08.02)Have a screen where scientists can start their own projects. After a project is started, have a details window where the stage of the project can be changed.
3. (15.02)Have the ability to select a rocket model. For the rocket model add a selection for different parts and fuel. 
4. (22.02)Have the ability to asert success chanse based on the selection of the rocket parts and fuel. Have the ability to calculate costs based on the same criteria.
5. (01.03)Make the stages be consiquent. You cannot go into the last stage after launch and then back to 3rd stage. Make going into each stage require a certain amount of parts. 
6. (08.03)Make a launch mechanism. After launch we should recieve data on how far the rocket traveled based on fuel, and a random factor (as with all rockets) and if the mission was successfull or not. 
7. (15.03)Have reports that let you see all your launches in one place so you can compare what went wrong, fix it and repeat the process in an even more GLORIOUS EXPLOSION. FOR SCIENCE!
